# Ghana Funeral Bot
A Discord Bot that takes 4(moved to 4 cuz 7 is too much and make no sense when song is playing) tokens
To mass join 1 voice channel to play any song you want (default was Astronomia)

[Example](https://gfycat.com/delightfulsillykronosaurus)

# How to setup
Clone the repo and be sure you have nodejs version 12.0 or later installed.
Run `<npm install>` in the same directory of packages.json
Go to config.json and add 4 tokens. 
`<token_guy1>`Will be the bot that plays music and be the first one to join.
Run the bot simply with `<node main.js >`

Simply type !g join in the voice channel you're in. (Be sure you have manage channels permission)

- If called in multiple voice chats in the same server, can cause errors.
